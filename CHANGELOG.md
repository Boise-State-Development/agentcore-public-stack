## [1.0.0-beta.24] - 2026-05-06

### 🚀 Added

- BFF Token Handler: cookie-based auth replacing `localStorage` Bearer tokens. Opaque session id in a `__Host-bff_session` httpOnly cookie sealed with AES-GCM under a KMS-wrapped data key; Cognito tokens stored server-side in `BFFSessionsTable`; confidential `CognitoBFFAppClient` (secret in Secrets Manager) for server-side code exchange; `SessionRefreshMiddleware` silently refreshes Cognito tokens; `CSRFMiddleware` enforces double-submit tokens on unsafe methods
- BFF auth routes on app-api: `GET /auth/login` (Cognito PKCE, optional `identity_provider` + `return_to`), `GET /auth/callback`, `GET /auth/session`, `POST /auth/logout` (returns `{post_logout_url}` so the SPA bounces through Cognito Hosted UI to clear the upstream session)
- Cookie-authenticated `POST /chat/stream` SSE proxy to inference-api `/invocations`; owns the `httpx.AsyncClient` lifecycle so headers flush immediately; forwards `OAuth2CallbackUrl` for tool-side OAuth consent scoping; `_build_upstream_url()` percent-encodes the AgentCore Runtime ARN as a single path segment and appends `?qualifier=DEFAULT`
- CloudFront `/api/*` behavior with a viewer-request prefix-strip function; SPA fallback scoped to S3 via a separate viewer-request function so API errors pass through unchanged
- Sliding session lifetime: cookie `Max-Age` and DDB row TTL bump on every successful resolution, capped at `BFF_SESSION_ABSOLUTE_LIFETIME_SECONDS` (default 30 d) and throttled by `BFF_SESSION_SLIDING_RENEWAL_THROTTLE_SECONDS`
- Voice mode WebSocket-ticket proxy on app-api: `POST /voice/ticket` + WebSocket `/voice/stream` with HMAC ticket codec, DynamoDB replay store, and per-text-frame `auth_token` / `user_id` injection on the upstream relay (#211, #233)
- Per-conversation cost + context-window badge above the composer, backed by write-time aggregation on the session row; color-graded SVG ring with tooltip showing underlying token counts including cache reads and writes (#223)
- Context compaction SSE event surfaced inline as an "Earlier messages summarized" indicator with cumulative turn count; rehydrates after refresh via `totalSummarizedTurns` on the session-metadata GET (#243)
- Per-model inference parameters with canonical-name translation to provider-native shapes; Anthropic extended thinking via `supportedParams.thinking` with budget validation and temperature/top_p/top_k suppression (#203)
- Settings → Advanced panel for per-request inference-param overrides, persisted in sessionStorage
- Frosted-glass login card with primary-color blob backdrop; respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (#246)
- `GET /admin/auth-providers/cognito-redirect-uri` for admin-only Cognito domain lookup (replaces the retired `/config.json` fetch)
- XLSX-specific RAG chunker with header-row heuristics that skip title/banner rows; multi-sheet name prefix preserves context across embeddings
- Batched S3 Vectors writes (50 vectors per batch) to prevent request-body-size failures on large embedding batches
- AST-based architectural boundary tests enforcing `inference_api`, `agents/`, `apis.shared`, and `app_api` import rules (#200)
- New infrastructure: `BFFSessionsTable`, `BFFCookieSigningKey` (KMS), `CognitoBFFAppClient` + secret, `VoiceTicketReplayTable`, `VoiceTicketSigningSecret`
- `CognitoConfig.supportedIdentityProviders` (env `CDK_COGNITO_SUPPORTED_IDPS`) so the BFF client can federate beyond COGNITO
- `.env.example` now documents Cognito and BFF Token Handler env vars (previously zero coverage)

### ✨ Improved

- BFF refresh-token rotation hardened: rotation writes retry up to three times with 50/100 ms backoff and fail closed if every attempt fails; no-rotation responses take a single best-effort write
- `CookieCodec` promoted to a process-wide singleton so the `/auth/callback` seal and `SessionRefreshMiddleware` unseal use the same KMS-derived key
- SSE proxies (`/chat/stream` and `/chat/api-converse`) now own the upstream `httpx.AsyncClient` lifecycle and close it in the generator's `finally` block so headers flush immediately (#217)
- BFF callback seeds the Users row directly from ID-token claims (`email`, `name`, `picture`, `custom:roles` / `cognito:groups`); fixes first-login users missing email and falling back to Cognito provider-group roles
- Anonymous-user 401 lands on SPA `/auth/login` (with `returnUrl`) instead of Cognito Hosted UI; 401 toasts suppressed while the redirect is in flight (#228)
- `LoginPage` now redirects authenticated users to `returnUrl` instead of requiring a manual Sign In click (#226)
- Migrated `APP_INITIALIZER` to Angular 19+ `provideAppInitializer`; bootstrap's 401 path now hangs the promise so the SPA can't render during the queued redirect (#226)
- Angular build defaults to production via `defaultConfiguration`; `ng serve` defaults to development
- `scripts/gen-version.js` prebuild hook reads the monorepo root `VERSION` file and emits `src/version.ts` so the bundle carries the committed version
- Cost-badge pricing sums per-message metadata (matching the persisted C# records) and includes `cacheReadInputTokens` + `cacheWriteInputTokens` in context-window occupancy
- Compaction state lazy-loads on the AgentCoreMemory existing-session path; prevents default-zero writes overwriting persisted counters on refresh
- `ChatStateService` seeds cost / context signals from session metadata on route change; clears stale state before new metadata loads
- Legacy sessions lazy-backfill `totalCost` and `lastContextTokens` on first read — no migration script required
- `ToolAccessService` catalog now sources from DynamoDB via `freshness.get_all_tool_ids`; admin create/update/delete invalidate the snapshot
- Google's `initiate_consent` path always sends `prompt=consent` so Disconnect/Reconnect actually re-issues a refresh token (#245)
- In-process token cache gained a TTL (default 3000 s) so AgentCore Identity's refresh flow gets a chance to run before the upstream 3600 s lifetime (#210)

### ⚠️ Changed

- **Breaking:** SPA-facing routes no longer accept `Authorization: Bearer`. Cookie auth is required. External callers must migrate to the BFF session flow or hit `/chat/agent-stream` (Bearer-only) instead
- **Breaking:** `POST /chat/stream` is now the cookie-authenticated BFF proxy. The legacy in-process agent loop moved to `POST /chat/agent-stream` for API-key and scripted callers
- **Breaking:** SPA `/auth/callback` route removed. The BFF callback at `${appApiUrl}/auth/callback` is the only OAuth landing
- **Breaking:** SSM parameters `/auth/cognito/app-client-id` and `/oauth/callback-url` deleted. Consumers must migrate to `/auth/cognito/bff-app-client-id` and register a per-system callback URL
- Public PKCE Cognito client decommissioned; `InferenceApiStack`'s runtime authorizer and `AppApiStack`'s `COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID` repoint to the BFF client
- `/config.json` runtime fetch retired; `appApiUrl`, `version`, and `cognitoDomainUrl` resolved via build-time injection + a dedicated admin endpoint
- `ConfigService` collapses to a thin signal accessor over `environment.appApiUrl`; `inferenceApiUrl`, `cognitoAppClientId`, `cognitoRegion`, and `environment` fields removed from `RuntimeConfig`
- `apis.app_api.costs`, `apis.app_api.tools.models`, `apis.app_api.storage`, and `apis.app_api.auth.api_keys` moved to `apis.shared.*`. Out-of-tree imports must update (#200)
- `lastTemperature` on `SessionPreferences` and `isReasoningModel` on `ManagedModel` removed; Pydantic v2 `extra="ignore"` handles legacy rows (#203)
- CloudFront origin `readTimeout` capped at the 60 s default max (was 180 s, which failed `InvalidRequest` on distribution update)
- CodeQL and Dependabot workflows retargeted from `develop` to `main` (#247)

### 🐛 Fixed

- CloudFront distribution-wide `errorResponses` rewrote `/api/*` 4xx into 200 + `index.html`; Angular `HttpClient` choked parsing HTML as JSON (#230)
- BFF chat proxy was calling the AgentCore Runtime data plane with the ARN unencoded and no `qualifier`; 404 on every `POST /chat/stream` (#231)
- `CDK_CERTIFICATE_ARN` missing from frontend synth/deploy jobs caused the `/api/*` origin to fall back to `HTTP_ONLY`, breaking same-origin `__Host-` cookie assumptions (#229)
- Frontend CI was building with `development` config on `develop`-branch cloud deploys, bundling `localhost:8000` into the deployed app; Private Network Access blocked loopback calls (#224)
- Trailing commas in `CDK_COGNITO_CALLBACK_URLS` / `CDK_COGNITO_LOGOUT_URLS` produced empty strings Cognito rejected with a regex validation error (#222)
- OAuth-paused agent orphaned after resume because the agent cache keyed on the unbuilt prompt but the snapshot persisted the built one; resume landed on a different slot, the paused agent got cache-hit on the next non-resume turn, Strands raised "must resume from interrupt" (#207)
- Cost summary writer raised `decimal.InvalidOperation` when `MessageMetadata.cost` was a breakdown dict instead of a float; rollup silently went stale (#208)
- `reasoningContent` blocks dropped by session persistence broke subsequent Bedrock calls on thinking + tool use turns (required thinking signature field missing) (#203)
- `ensure_session_metadata_exists` GSI gating (#194) regression test: `preview-chat` spec race where mock pollution in the shared vitest worker pool failed with cryptic "undefined" error instead of a clear assertion
- `preview-chat` test flake from module-level `vi.mock('@microsoft/fetch-event-source')` resolved to a different `vi.fn()` instance under the shared worker pool; replaced with a `FETCH_EVENT_SOURCE` `InjectionToken`
- `cost.service.spec` absorbed stray `resource()` loader request by switching to `httpMock.match(...)` (#225)
- Agentcore-identity tests were failing when local `.env` defined `AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_WORKLOAD_NAME`; autouse fixture now scrubs it (#214)
- Session cost/context signals previously preserved stale values across session changes; seed + reset on route change fixes it (#223)
- Compaction state wrote default zeros on first sub-threshold turn of an existing AgentCoreMemory session; lazy-load on `update_after_turn` fixes the silent undercounting (#243)
- `_merge_inference_params` ungated request-side passthrough could let users submit future canonical keys the admin hadn't bounded; now gated against `KNOWN_CANONICAL_PARAMS` (#203)
- Voice WS config-frame injection was a one-shot flag; a SPA sending any non-config text frame first could consume the slot and let subsequent config frames forge identity. Injection now runs on every text-type frame and overwrites `user_id` (#233)
- Cross-origin `HttpClient` requests to app-api now carry the BFF cookie via a new `withCredentialsInterceptor`; previously 160+ calls 401'd after a successful cross-origin login (#221)
- `/auth/callback` same-origin `return_to` splice grafts the scheme + netloc from `BFF_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` onto the path so cross-origin dev (`:8000` → `:4200`) lands on the SPA origin (#221)

### 🔒 Security

- BFF `return_to` control-byte bypass closed — `_sanitized_return_to` rejects all C0 control bytes (U+0000..U+001F), not just CR/LF, defeating browser URL-parser strip tricks like `/\t/evil.com` (#221)
- AES-GCM cookie codec now binds the cookie version byte into associated data and stops swallowing KMS infrastructure errors as decode failures (transient KMS hiccups no longer log every active user out) (#213)
- BFF session-cookie tokens validated against `COGNITO_BFF_APP_CLIENT_ID` by a separate validator instance; the SPA validator's client_id check would have rejected every BFF-issued token (#213)
- Pygments 2.19.2 → 2.20.0 (ReDoS in GUID-matching regex, Dependabot alert #71) (#247)
- CodeQL remediation: log-injection on user-controlled `model_id` and other inputs, unused imports/locals across infrastructure, explanatory comments on empty-except blocks (#247)
- Markdown-rendered links remain `rel="noopener noreferrer"` (carried from beta.23)
- Dependabot security alerts resolved: pillow 12.2.0, cryptography 47.0.0, python-multipart 0.0.27, aiohttp 3.13.5, uuid 14.0.0 (#199)
